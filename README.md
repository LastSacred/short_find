# short_find

Allow a user to find things by typing just enough letters and/or numbers to make it unique. The user can enter a string of letters. Ignoring case, spaces, and special characters, if there is only one match, short_find will return the item that starts with those characters. If no item is matched, or if more than one item is matched it will give an error and allow the user to try again.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'short_find'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install short_find

When called, takes input from the command line and uses it to find and return the object with the attribute that starts with the inputted characters.

### ShortFind.in_array(array)
Takes in an array strings, or objects of a type that can be converted to a string.
